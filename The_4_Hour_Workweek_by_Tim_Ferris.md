## The 4-Hour Workweek

by Timothy Ferris

### Chapter 1: D is for Definition
* page 49: don't think about big paydays or retiring early. The New Rich (NR) think about how to make others work for you and problems of the world that are being solved by them. Furthermore, they think of steady income through this problem solving and becoming the best versions of themselves through experience.
* page 51: the NR is about freeing your time and place day to day through outsourcing or schedule rearranging.
* page 60: "Sports evolve when sacred cows are killed, when basic assumptions are tested." think outside the box to break the rules and those who see it's use will follow.
* page 67: makes me immediately think of doing my work fast and then focusing on my other goals. Also, "get good at being a troublemaker and saying sorry when you really screw up." -> ask for forgiveness, not permission. Also, income is relative, it is what you do with that which puts you ahead. I aim to stress myself out in a good way (eustress) and thus not just laze around.
* page 80: do not fear as the condition you may end up in would probably not be as life changing or ruining as you expect. "I am an old man and have known a great many troubles, but most of them never happened." - Mark Twain
* page 90: also think about what you are putting off out of fear and the cost of this —financially, emotionally, and physically.
* page 97: "The fishing is best where the fewest go, and the collective insecurity of the world makes it easy for people to hit home runs while everyone else is aiming for base hits. There is just less competition for bigger goals." The more unrealistic goals are easier than the realistic ones.

### Chapter 2: E is for Elimination
* page 120: Forget about time management, we spend too long doing many things instead of focusing on what is important. It is necessary to do less to accomplish more.
* page 124: Doing something unimportant well does not make it important. Requiring a lot of time does not make a task important.
* page 126: pareto law -> 80% of the results come from 20% of the effort and time or 80% of company profits come from 20% of the products and customers.
* page 131: Most things make no difference. Being busy is a form of laziness—lazy thinking and indiscriminate action.
* page 136: Parkinson’s Law dictates that a task will swell in (perceived) importance and complexity in relation to the time allotted for its completion. It is the magic of the imminent deadline.
* page 136: Hence, limit tasks to the important to shorten work time (80/20) and shorten work time to limit tasks to the important (Parkinson’s Law).
* page 161: on the topic of selective ignorance: "Will I definitely use this information for something immediate and important?" and also "More is not better, and stopping something is often 10 times better than finishing it."
* page 180: regarding effectiveness and efficiency in the office, you should limit the amount of times you check emails daily, you should also keep two phones (with one for emergencies) and try to cut down everything really (like conversations, meetings - should be held to make decisions, etc).
* page 192: "Limit access to your time, force people to define their requests before spending time with them, and batch routine menial tasks to prevent postponement of more important projects. Do not let people interrupt you. Find your focus and you’ll find your lifestyle."
* page 225: "Each delegated task must be both time-consuming and well-defined. If you’re running around like a chicken with its head cut off and assign your VA to do that for you, it doesn’t improve the order of the universe." where VA is a virtual assistant, someone you can outsource your daily tasks to virtually for a cheaper price than you are being paid.
* page 230: there are lots of things you can do with VAs, just check it out and try it to get more experienced. Do not be afraid to have a bad one.
* page 238: hire a VA firm or VAs with backup teams instead of sole operators -> Brickwork and YMII both exemplify this type of structure and provide a single point of contact, a personal account manager, who then farms out your tasks to the most-capable people in the group and across different shifts.
