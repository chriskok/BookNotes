## The 4-Hour Workweek

by Timothy Ferris

### Chapter 1: D is for Definition
* page 49: don't think about big paydays or retiring early. The New Rich (NR) think about how to make others work for you and problems of the world that are being solved by them. Furthermore, they think of steady income through this problem solving and becoming the best versions of themselves through experience.
* page 51: the NR is about freeing your time and place day to day through outsourcing or schedule rearranging.
* page 60: "Sports evolve when sacred cows are killed, when basic assumptions are tested." think outside the box to break the rules and those who see it's use will follow.
* page 67: makes me immediately think of doing my work fast and then focusing on my other goals. Also, "get good at being a troublemaker and saying sorry when you really screw up." -> ask for forgiveness, not permission. Also, income is relative, it is what you do with that which puts you ahead. I aim to stress myself out in a good way (eustress) and thus not just laze around.
* stopped at page 75
