## The 4-Hour Workweek

by Timothy Ferris

### Chapter 1: D is for Definition
* page 49: don't think about big paydays or retiring early. The New Rich (NR) think about how to make others work for you and problems of the world that are being solved by them. Furthermore, they think of steady income through this problem solving and becoming the best versions of themselves through experience.
* page 51: the NR is about freeing your time and place day to day through outsourcing or schedule rearranging.
* page 60: "Sports evolve when sacred cows are killed, when basic assumptions are tested." think outside the box to break the rules and those who see it's use will follow.
* page 67: makes me immediately think of doing my work fast and then focusing on my other goals. Also, "get good at being a troublemaker and saying sorry when you really screw up." -> ask for forgiveness, not permission. Also, income is relative, it is what you do with that which puts you ahead. I aim to stress myself out in a good way (eustress) and thus not just laze around.
* page 80: do not fear as the condition you may end up in would probably not be as life changing or ruining as you expect. "I am an old man and have known a great many troubles, but most of them never happened." - Mark Twain
* page 90: also think about what you are putting off out of fear and the cost of this â€”financially, emotionally, and physically.
* page 97: "The fishing is best where the fewest go, and the collective insecurity of the world makes it easy for people to hit home runs while everyone else is aiming for base hits. There is just less competition for bigger goals." The more unrealistic goals are easier than the realistic ones.

### Chapter 2: E is for Elimination
* page 120: Forget about time management, we spend too long doing many things instead of focusing on what is important. It is necessary to do less to accomplish more.
