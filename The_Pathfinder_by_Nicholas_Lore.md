## The Pathfinder

by Nicholas Lore

### Chapter 1: This can be your guide
* page 20: The book will provide action plans in helping you find the career and life you desire. It suggests leaving space for scratch work which I will provide a subsection for [HERE](#workspace).

### Chapter 2: You are what you do
* page 22: Inquiry 1 - Remember your fantasies growing up? Work vs Our Fantasies.
* page 26: About 30% of people like of love the work they do.
* page 31: "You are what you repeatedly do" - Aristotle. MANY people do jobs that they consistently do not like or do not fit their strengths. If we took the time to find that, we would live healthier and longer lives. Also, you'd have better relationships (happy people attract happy people), you'd be more productive, have higher self-esteem and be a better role model for kids.
* page 33: Inquiry 2 - What's life like with a perfect career? Close your eyes and imagine it.

### Chapter 3: How to decide
* page 41: The base of our igloo (The basic things to consider) are passion, personality, natural talent (whether they all fit you), stretching boundaries, fulfilling goals, rewards that fit your values, compatible working environment and the bottom line. We ask these questions to break down the mammoth "What to do with my life" question.
* note: The rest of the chapter feels a little like repetition but he acknowledges this and says that repetition is necessary for learning and also judgement of our habits is required to know what we want to change.
* note: Basically the rest of chapter 3 describes some other chapters of the book and how to use them to their fullest, make a list, whittle it down and don't give up till you achieve your dreams.

### Chapter 4: Use The Pathfinder as your guide

## Workspace
* page 33: I've recently spoke to people about being subject matter experts in the Machine Learning field and to me that sounds pretty perfect. Understanding the very edge of our science and putting together the pieces to make things work. Another thing I'd really like to achieve is the freedom to work from home or at least be at home a lot. I know I want to be in absolute control over the problems I solve daily, unsure of whether that can be achieved in a managerial position.
