## The Pathfinder

by Nicholas Lore

### Chapter 1: This can be your guide
* page 20: The book will provide action plans in helping you find the career and life you desire. It suggests leaving space for scratch work which I will provide a subsection for [HERE](#workspace).

### Chapter 2: You are what you do
* page 22: Inquiry 1 - Remember your fantasies growing up? Work vs Our Fantasies.
* page 26: About 30% of people like of love the work they do.
* page 31: "You are what you repeatedly do" - Aristotle. MANY people do jobs that they consistently do not like or do not fit their strengths. If we took the time to find that, we would live healthier and longer lives. Also, you'd have better relationships (happy people attract happy people), you'd be more productive, have higher self-esteem and be a better role model for kids.
* page 33: Inquiry 2 - What's life like with a perfect career? Close your eyes and imagine it.

### Chapter 3: How to decide
* page 41: The base of our igloo (The basic things to consider) are passion, personality, natural talent (whether they all fit you), stretching boundaries, fulfilling goals, rewards that fit your values, compatible working environment and the bottom line. We ask these questions to break down the mammoth "What to do with my life" question.
* note: The rest of the chapter feels a little like repetition but he acknowledges this and says that repetition is necessary for learning and also judgement of our habits is required to know what we want to change.
* note: Basically the rest of chapter 3 describes some other chapters of the book and how to use them to their fullest, make a list, whittle it down and don't give up till you achieve your dreams.

### Chapter 4: Use The Pathfinder as your guide
* page 55: Provided activities that I completed [BELOW](#pg55).

### Chapter 5: Why you don't get what you want
* page 66: Understanding habits is crucial to steering the ships that are our brains to a chosen destination.
* page 68: Nature wants everything to be in a state of homeostasis (everything is balanced) including our happiness levels. Does this mean we should go against it and attempt to break this defense?
* page 69: This is where Yeahbuts come in. It is a safety mechanism that stops us from getting what we truly want. eg: I’m constrained by my circumstances, my mortgage, my bad back, no time. The circumstances are like a vise around me, holding me here. I can’t do anything about it. eg 2: I can’t do what I want because the fun careers pay less.
* page 71: We aren't only influenced by our own thoughts but by those around us (including those on youtube and quora). They define the limits in our thoughts and behavior.
* page 72: List of personal Yeahbuts [BELOW](#pg72).

### Chapter 6: The power of commitment

## Workspace
* page 33: I've recently spoke to people about being subject matter experts in the Machine Learning field and to me that sounds pretty perfect. Understanding the very edge of our science and putting together the pieces to make things work. Another thing I'd really like to achieve is the freedom to work from home or at least be at home a lot. I know I want to be in absolute control over the problems I solve daily, unsure of whether that can be achieved in a managerial position.

* page 55: Make sure I have all of these in my future position. note: I have most of these now
  - I enjoy going to work. I don’t have trouble getting up in the morning because what I do is interesting and challenging.
  - My work is a natural expression of my talents and personality.
  - Success comes easily to me because I am extremely good at what I do.
  - I am proud of what I do and enjoy telling other people about it.
  - I am highly respected at work because I’m so good at what I do.
  - Work is often so enjoyable it feels more like play.
  - My job provides a flow of interesting problems to solve, ones I find exciting and challenging.
  - I don’t have to pretend to be someone else at work because my personality suits my work.
  - I’m paid to make use of my own best and most natural forms of creative expression.
  - My work environment brings out my best efforts. (clue: the people are amazing, I need to decorate more)
  - My job fits my most important values and allows me to fulfill my goals in terms of personal growth and achievement goals, income, stability, and so on.
  - The result of my efforts makes a contribution that personally matters to me. I feel I am doing something that makes a difference. (X | clue: It hasn't hit me yet what impact I'm going to make)
  - My job does not take over my entire life. I have plenty of time for friends, family, and fun outside of work.
  - I like the people I work with.
  - I am on a winning team that is having a great time getting the job done. (clue: I don't feel like I'm contributing enough to the great team I have)
  - A day on the job leaves me feeling energized, not burned out.


* page 58: My life line, what I'd like to accomplish over the years. Questions: “What would I most like to accomplish between the years of X and Y?”, “What would I want to have done?”, “Who would I like to be by then?”, “What would I like to have by then?”
  - age 25: Senior engineer position, get married, travel a lot to experience different cultures, try my best to make the most of my youth
  - age 30: Kids, settle down and own a comfortable house, principal engineer position? (idk how long these take), secure financial plan for the future (knowing that my kids will be able to go through college without loans)
  - age 35: Subject matter expert in my field, nothing material comes to mind, I just hope to be really good at parenting

* page 72: List of Yeahbuts to keep an eye out for
  - Yeahbut I won't have enough money if I'm not doing something like Machine Learning (120k salary on average).
  - Yeahbut I won't get as much money if I don't work in the Silicon Valley (conflicted because I really like Cedar Rapids, and I am unsure as to the exchange between the higher cost of living there and whether they even out).
  - Yeahbut I'm an immigrant and should prioritize staying here over the comfort of my job and position.
