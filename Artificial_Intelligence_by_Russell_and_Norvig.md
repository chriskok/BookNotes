## Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach

by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig

### Chapter 1: Introduction
* pg 2: A computer passes the Turing Test if a human interrogator posses some written questions that are answered by the computer that are indistinguishable from human writing. The computer would have to have many skills like natural language processing and automated reasoning. Created by the award winning Alan Turing (1950).
* pg 8: Fun fact - The word algorithm (and the idea of studying them) comes from al-Khowarazmi, a Persian mathematician of the 9th century, whose writings also introduced Arabic numerals and algebra to Europe. 
* pg 16: AI is founded upon the questions of many fields such as Psychology, Philosophy, Economics, Linguistics, and Cybernetics. I'll keep these questions in mind when finding out what new problems I can attempt to solve, seems pretty hard to find some right now.
