## Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach

by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig

### Chapter 1: Introduction
* pg 2: A computer passes the Turing Test if a human interrogator posses some written questions that are answered by the computer that are indistinguishable from human writing. The computer would have to have many skills like natural language processing and automated reasoning. Created by the award winning Alan Turing (1950).
* pg 8: Fun fact - The word algorithm (and the idea of studying them) comes from al-Khowarazmi, a Persian mathematician of the 9th century, whose writings also introduced Arabic numerals and algebra to Europe. 
* pg 16: AI is founded upon the questions of many fields such as Psychology, Philosophy, Economics, Linguistics, and Cybernetics. I'll keep these questions in mind when finding out what new problems I can attempt to solve, seems pretty hard to find some right now.

### Chapter 2: Intelligent Agents
* pg 34: An agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators. Or PEAS (Performance, Environemtn, Actuators, Sensors). 
* pg 37: As a general rule, it is better to design performance measures (evaluation of environmental states) according to what one actually wants in the environment, rather than according to how one thinks the agent should behave. Like giving the agent rewards. 
* pg 37: Rationality of an agent depends on 1. The performance measure that defines the success criterion, 2. The agent's prior knowledge of the environment, 3. The actions that can be performed, 4. The agent's percept sequence to date. 
* pg 42: Fully vs Partially observable environments (the ability to measure success within the environment).
* pg 43: Single (crossword) vs Multiagent(chess) environments; where agent A might depends on another (or multiple other) agents B, C, etc. 
* pg 43: Deterministic vs Stochastic situations; most real-life ones are hard to be deterministic especially the partially oberservable. 
* pg 43: Episodic (the next episode doesn't depend on the previous ones, like american tv series) vs Sequential (current decision could affect all else, like anime).
