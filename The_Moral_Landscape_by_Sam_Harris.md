## The Moral Landscape

by Sam Harris

### Chapter 0: Introduction to The Moral Landscape
* page 15: human well-being entirely depends on events in the world and on states of the human brain. The aim of this book is to prove that certain values and morals can be scientifically evaluated as better or worse
* page 18: hitting children as punishment can be proven to be bad through science and is something we cannot afford to simply respect out of "tradition"
* page 21: "Faith, if it is ever right about anything, is right by accident." in argument of religion having authority on meaning, values, morality and the good life. He argues that rational, open-ended, honest inquiry has always been the true source of insight.
* page 44: the difference between the good life and bad life examples have lawful relationship to human behavior, societal conditions, or states of the brain (premise 2). If you believe otherwise, this book aint for you.
* page 54: social scientists incorrectly believe that all long-standing human practices must be evolutionarily adaptive: for how else could they persist?

### Chapter 1: Moral Truth
* page 68: "I am arguing that science can, in principle, help us understand what we should do and should wantâ€”and, therefore, what other people should do and should want in order to live the best lives possible"
* page 77: we can see that in many parts of the book there is a double standard between morality and science. The example given here is how scientific truth is seen to exist if there is consensus while controversy is a sign of work to be done. Meanwhile, moral controversy proves that there can be no such thing as moral truth, while moral consensus shows only that human beings often harbor the same biases. 
* page 78: just as a personal note, a lot of his proofs remind me of logical reasoning we have been through in discrete math and algorithm classes.
* stopped on page 91
