## The Moral Landscape

by Sam Harris

### Chapter 0: Introduction to The Moral Landscape
* page 15: human well-being entirely depends on events in the world and on states of the human brain. The aim of this book is to prove that certain values and morals can be scientifically evaluated as better or worse
* page 18: hitting children as punishment can be proven to be bad through science and is something we cannot afford to simply respect out of "tradition"
* page 21: "Faith, if it is ever right about anything, is right by accident." in argument of religion having authority on meaning, values, morality and the good life. He argues that rational, open-ended, honest inquiry has always been the true source of insight.
* page 44: the difference between the good life and bad life examples have lawful relationship to human behavior, societal conditions, or states of the brain (premise 2). If you believe otherwise, this book aint for you.
* page 54: social scientists incorrectly believe that all long-standing human practices must be evolutionarily adaptive: for how else could they persist?

### Chapter 1: Moral Truth
* page 68: "I am arguing that science can, in principle, help us understand what we should do and should want—and, therefore, what other people should do and should want in order to live the best lives possible"
* page 77: we can see that in many parts of the book there is a double standard between morality and science. The example given here is how scientific truth is seen to exist if there is consensus while controversy is a sign of work to be done. Meanwhile, moral controversy proves that there can be no such thing as moral truth, while moral consensus shows only that human beings often harbor the same biases. 
* page 78: just as a personal note, a lot of his proofs remind me of logical reasoning we have been through in discrete math and algorithm classes.
* page 108: in terms of female circumcition when one person does it, it will be considered a crime. But when millions of people do this, instead of the enormity being magnified millions-fold, suddenly it becomes “culture,” and thereby magically becomes less, rather than more, horrible, and is even defended by some Western “moral thinkers,” including feminists. (Steven Pinker, The Blank Slate)
* page 108: he mostly argues the morality of traditions that would subtract from human well-being (eg: burqas). Also, I think it is very important that he debunks the double standards mentioned earlier to show that we shouldn't just put off morality as 'depending on your personal beliefs or culture' but instead justifying the need for a more universal foundation for human values. Must say that this reminds me a lot of utilitarianism (remember him saying that we were to judge the collective happiness and measure that over the number of people affected in two situations).

### Chapter 2: Good and Evil
* page 154: "Most scientists seem to believe that no matter how maladaptive or masochistic a person’s moral commitments, it is impossible to say that he is ever mistaken about what constitutes a good life."
