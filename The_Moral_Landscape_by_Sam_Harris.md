## The Moral Landscape

by Sam Harris

### Chapter 0: Introduction to The Moral Landscape
* page 15: human well-being entirely depends on events in the world and on states of the human brain. The aim of this book is to prove that certain values and morals can be scientifically evaluated as better or worse
* page 18: hitting children as punishment can be proven to be bad through science and is something we cannot afford to simply respect out of "tradition"
* page 21: "Faith, if it is ever right about anything, is right by accident." in argument of religion having authority on meaning, values, morality and the good life. He argues that rational, open-ended, honest inquiry has always been the true source of insight.
* page 44: the difference between the good life and bad life examples have lawful relationship to human behavior, societal conditions, or states of the brain (premise 2). If you believe otherwise, this book aint for you.
* page 54: social scientists incorrectly believe that all long-standing human practices must be evolutionarily adaptive: for how else could they persist?

### Chapter 1: Moral Truth
* page 68: "I am arguing that science can, in principle, help us understand what we should do and should want—and, therefore, what other people should do and should want in order to live the best lives possible"
* page 77: we can see that in many parts of the book there is a double standard between morality and science. The example given here is how scientific truth is seen to exist if there is consensus while controversy is a sign of work to be done. Meanwhile, moral controversy proves that there can be no such thing as moral truth, while moral consensus shows only that human beings often harbor the same biases. 
* page 78: just as a personal note, a lot of his proofs remind me of logical reasoning we have been through in discrete math and algorithm classes.
* page 108: in terms of female circumcition when one person does it, it will be considered a crime. But when millions of people do this, instead of the enormity being magnified millions-fold, suddenly it becomes “culture,” and thereby magically becomes less, rather than more, horrible, and is even defended by some Western “moral thinkers,” including feminists. (Steven Pinker, The Blank Slate)
* page 108: he mostly argues the morality of traditions that would subtract from human well-being (eg: burqas). Also, I think it is very important that he debunks the double standards mentioned earlier to show that we shouldn't just put off morality as 'depending on your personal beliefs or culture' but instead justifying the need for a more universal foundation for human values. Must say that this reminds me a lot of utilitarianism (remember him saying that we were to judge the collective happiness and measure that over the number of people affected in two situations).

### Chapter 2: Good and Evil
* page 154: "Most scientists seem to believe that no matter how maladaptive or masochistic a person’s moral commitments, it is impossible to say that he is ever mistaken about what constitutes a good life."
* page 157: “identifiable victim effect.” by Paul Slovic states that when the number of people increase the less we care (eg: one starving child vs a hundred)
* page 170: In psychologist Daniel Kahneman’s words, “a good is worth more when it is considered as something that could be lost or given up than when it is evaluated as a potential gain." In this case, it shows that we have to take value of loss into consideration during moral questions (eg: girl who lost 100 iq vs the girl who stayed but couldved doubled)
* page 177: argument for why not to refer to religious scripture as source of moral guidance
* page 190: "One norm that morality and rationality share is the interchangeability of perspective.47 The solution to a problem should not depend on whether you are the husband or the wife, the employer or employee, the creditor or debtor, etc." This is in relation to the Theory of Justice by John Rawls where he says you can build any society you want as long as you don't make the assumption that you are a certain kind of person (male/female, black/white, etc.)
* page 192: on the topic of "being good is hard" we realize that we cannot always make the absolute best choice due to our own competing needs. What we can do is try, within practical limits, to follow a path that seems likely to maximize both our own well-being and the well-being of others. This is what it means to live wisely and ethically.
* page 199: Haidt is right to notice that the brain’s emotional circuitry often governs our moral intuitions, and the way in which feeling drives judgment is surely worthy of study because it is now well known that our feeling of reasoning objectively is often illusory.
* page 230: argument on free will, and on page 237, what happens to the court system if there is no free will
* page 241: What we condemn in another person is the intention to do harm—and thus any condition or circumstance (e.g., accident, mental illness, youth) that makes it unlikely that a person could harbor such an intention would mitigate guilt, without any recourse to notions of free will.

### Chapter 3: Belief
* page 261: this chapter explores belief in a sense of mental acceptance of a proposition; the act of grasping a concept instead of the concept itself.
* page 273: the MPFC appears to be similarly engaged, irrespective of a belief’s content. This finding of content-independence challenges the fact/value distinction very directly: for if, from the point of view of the brain, believing “the sun is a star” is importantly similar to believing “cruelty is wrong,” how can we say that scientific and ethical judgments have nothing in common?
* page 276: the internet has simultaneously enabled two opposing influences on belief: On the one hand, it has reduced intellectual isolation by making it more difficult for people to remain ignorant of the diversity of opinion on any given subject. But it has also allowed bad ideas to flourish—as anyone with a computer and too much time on his hands can broadcast his point of view and, often enough, find an audience.
* page 285: argument on how the gap between believers and non believers in religion could be bridged through reason.
* stopped on page 292: Belief and Reasoning
