## Zero to One

by Peter Thiel

* page 19: "What important truth do very few people agree with you on?", defining your problem begins with this question I believe. "what valuable company is nobody building?"
* page 42: both monopolists and competitive companies lie. They lie about being smaller than they really are or more special than they really are (to themselves sometimes, without checking the competition) respectively.
* page 52: "Monopoly is the condition of every successful business."
* page 66: "anyone would fight for things that matter; true heroes take their personal honor so seriously they will fight for things that don’t matter." competition is destructive in business and monopolies will win you the game
* page 72: characteristics of monolopy -> Proprietary technology, network effects, economies, branding
* page 84: "The most successful companies make the core progression—to first dominate a specific niche and then scale to adjacent markets—a part of their founding narrative."
* page 121: "A business with a good definite plan will always be underrated in a world where people see the future as random" this portion of the book talks a lot about thinking optimistically vs pessimictically and definite vs indefinite. The goal is to be definite about your future and (in the case of China) pessimistically as well because you are more likely to invest and save more(?). Nevermind, note: "The other three views of the future can work. Definite optimism works when you build the future you envision. Definite pessimism works by building what can be copied without expecting anything new." So in the case of China, they copy a lot but experience nothing new.
